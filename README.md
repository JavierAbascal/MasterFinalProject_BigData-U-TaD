The technologies used are

1. RESTWebservice (java)
2. Kafka
2. Spark
3. InfluxDB
4. Grafana




## Some important notes ##

#### Kafka ####

If you run your Kafka server in a Amazon EC2 instance it is important to set in the `config/server.properties` file the next parameter `advertised.host.name=52.16.238.20 // EC2 IP Address`. Otherwise, you won't be able to connect to your Kafka broker
